We communicated with the larger team by holding weekly meetings. One person per team is required to represent the group at these meetings. 
We usually had everyone there, but we were better at taking advantage of this policy this term.
&  
& \\ \hline

We asked for extensions when we needed one. Asking for more time when we needed it was a goal that we set in fall term's retrospective. 
& 
& We accomplished the change that we wanted to from last term, no further changes needed. \\ \hline

We were very productive this term and got a lot of our work done.
& The bulk of our work had to happen this term, which was a lot of work.
& We could have been more strategic about planning to have fewer dependencies for the software so that we 
could have started sooner. We also could have been better about telling each other exactly when we were working on 
our different tasks. \\ \hline

We discussed the incorrect assumptions to get everyone on the same page
& Occasional miscommunications between everyone regarding incorrect assumptions about the design
& Continue discussing misconceptions when they come up \\ \hline

Helena delegated some work to James!
& Helena micro-managed a bit
& Helena should focus on letting things go and not stressing about everything. \\ \hline

& The team is getting a bit scattered due to half of the ME's and EE's graduating and starting full time jobs.
& We have to be more efficient and meeting even when some people are missing in order to compensate for this. 
We also have to be more mindful of our communication to make sure that we all stay on the same page. \\ \hline

We showed up to all of the required classes for CS463, and Helena even brought coffee for the team one class.
& & \\ \hline

& We were a bit scattered this term, generally having divided focus when working on things because of how much work we had.
& We should be more focused as this would make us more efficient. It would be better for us to focus on one task or assignment
at a time before moving on instead of jumping between multiple different tasks. \\ \hline

We were a supportive team within software this term. We communicated well with each other when we were struggling and have a good team dynamic going.
& We still have some conflicts within the larger group as a couple of the ME's still can't keep Amber and I straight and frequently call us by the 
wrong name.
& We need to keep this good rapport going, and even improving our teamwork, as this will make our expo pitch 
even more effective. \\ \hline
