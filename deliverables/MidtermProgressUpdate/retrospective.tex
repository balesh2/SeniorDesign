We communicated with the larger team by holding weekly meetings. One person per team is required to represent the group at these meetings. & We did not take advantage of only one team member being required to attend the all-team meetings and usually had all three of our team members there. & We could change to usually only have two members attending, or not. \\ \hline

	We have established cross-functional team meetings. There are three cross functional teams, each with one member from the four main teams. The cross-functional teams meet once per week and report back to the rest of the groups. & The Electrical Integration team did not have much to talk about throughout this term due to delays in getting the motors. & Motors have now been acquired, no further changes needed. \\ \hline

We asked for an extension on the progress update when we needed one. Asking for more time when we needed it was a goal that we set in last term's retrospective. & & We accomplished the change that we wanted to from last term, no further changes needed. \\ \hline

We learned about conflict resolution this term. & I (Helena) was not at my usual productivity and reliability levels, which put the rest of the team in an uncomfortable situation. I completed the work that I needed to, but did not communicate well enough with the rest of the team. & We talked as a group about how to resolve these issues and have improved our group dynamic and communication.\\ \hline

 & We were blocked from making progress on the technical side of the project for most of the term due to the delay in funding and receiving the motors. & In the future we should be more careful about parallelizing the technical tasks to decrease the affect of any blocks. \\ \hline

We a design review with the RockSat-X program office where we presented to a reviewer. This helped
us formally document the overall project. & Due to the time difference and the limitation of accomodating 16 schedules, we had to present at 6 AM
& We could stop whinning about how early our design reviews always are. \\ \hline

We discussed the incorrect assumptions to get everyone on the same page 
& Occasional miscommunications between everyone regarding incorrect assumptions about the design
& Continue discussing misconceptions when they come up \\ \hline
