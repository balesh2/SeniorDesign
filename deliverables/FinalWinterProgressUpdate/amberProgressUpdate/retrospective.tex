We communicated with the larger team by holding weekly meetings. One person per team is required to represent the group at these meetings. 
&  
& We started having only one or two members attend when necessary. \\ \hline

We have established cross-functional team meetings. There are three cross functional teams, each with one member from the four main teams. The cross-functional teams meet once per week and report back to the rest of the groups. 
& We failed to report back earlier in the term about what was accomplished during these meetings.
& We started posting updates about the meetings on a shared chat. \\ \hline

We asked for an extension on the progress update when we needed one. Asking for more time when we 
needed it was a goal that we set in last term's retrospective. 
& 
& We accomplished the change that we wanted to from last term, no further changes needed. \\ \hline

We learned about conflict resolution this term. & 
Our team had difficulty communicating with one another and this caused stress and uncomfortable
social dynamics between team members.
& We talked as a group about how to resolve these issues and have improved our group dynamic and 
communication.\\ \hline

 & We were blocked from making progress on the technical side of the project for most of the term due to 
 the delay in funding, receiving the motors, and not having a fully-assembled payload to work with. 
 & In the future we should be more careful about parallelizing the technical tasks to decrease the affect of any blocks. \\ \hline
