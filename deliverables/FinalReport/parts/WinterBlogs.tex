\subsubsection{Week 1}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
I made no progress over winter break, other than actually managing to take a vacation. I am very proud of myself.

Since the start of week 1, I met with the Software Team to discuss the schedule that we will have for the term. We decided that we would have an hour long meeting on Mondays after our TA meeting and an hour long meeting with the whole Hephaestus team on Thursdays at 6pm. We have not yet had a Monday meeting because the past two mondays have been cancelled due to weather and MLK Day.

We accomplished some tasks for week 1, which includes adding more content to the System Architecture for the Software Subsystem. In addition to this planning I began development of the test cases that will be used to test the Software Subsystem. Specifically, I am focusing on developing experiments to test the three functional requirements that I was assigned last term.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
The plan for next week is to finish up the architecture diagram and the test cases and beginning the implementation phase of the project. We need to have a prototype completed and tested by mid February, so we are planning on implementing for three weeks then testing.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
My biggest problem is that I do not have a working computer right now. I have been trying to fix my computer but it has just been a time sink so far. I don't have a solution to this problem.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week we attempted to gather ourselves after winter break and make a game plan for this coming term. We met as a 
group and worked on figuring out what needs to get done within the next 5 weeks and set small goals for each coming 
week. We are meeting with our EE collaborators next week to figure out telemetry codes. I've downloaded Atmel studio 
so I can start writing code. We are divvying out work based on our design document from last term.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
For the next week, I am hoping to begin work with the telemetry side of the project and help Michael.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
So far, we have not encountered any barriers. The only issue is coordinating schedules, which was an issue we 
encountered last term as well. What mitigated that issue was clear and consistent communication across teams, which
our newly established subteams should help with. I am serving as the representative for the Physical Integration team
which is the team in charge of ensuring all the mechanical pieces get manufactured and put together properly. 

\subsubsubsection{Michael Humphrey}

\subsubsection{Week 2}
\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week was somewhat odd due to the short week the previous week because of snow throwing off our progress and the
 shortness of this week due to Martin Luther King Jr. day. Little progress was made this week. The only progress made
 was attempting to work on our team organizational skills and begin documenting our individual process through a 
 scrum document that Michael set up. 

\textbf{Plans} \\
There was also a change in project delegation as the EE's decided that they want a local storage for the 
microcontroller in the form of an SD card. I will begin looking into lightweight, Atmel-compliant storage systems
that interface with an SD card.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
Our barriers have been limited to lack of time between all of us. Also, due to having irregular meetings, we are
having issues knowing what each other are doing and how to keep track of differing obligations and deadlines.
We are attempting to overcome this with the scrum document which should allow for less in-person meetings
and more communication about what we are all doing on our own time. We also are waiting on the EE's for their driver 
code they are writing for us. They have been tasked with writing the C code that will interface with the motors.

\subsubsection{Week 3}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week we started really diving into the motion planning in the Pathing and Automation cross-functional team. I checked out books from the library to help with research into motion planning for robotics, robotics in space, and inverse kinematics.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
Over the next weeks I will be doing research into the issues of path planning and motion tracking on earth and in space.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
I still don't have a working computer with which to do the research.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week we got the code from the EE's for interfacing with the microcontroller. I also did research on SD card 
interfaces with microcontrollers that we are now using to write data from the microcontroller to an SD card. This 
code will be up on Github once we translate it from the Atmega 16 pins to the Atmega 64 (which we are using). I worked
with the EE's to accomplish this translation as they are more familiar with the Atmega 64 archictecture than I am.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
Our next step is to make the code compliant with the Atmega64 archictecture. I will also begin work on writing code
that utilizes this library so that we can write telemetry codes, sensor touch data, and other log data to the card
for post-mortem analysis.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
The problems we have encountered include illness and traveling. When we do not have teammates available, it can be
difficult to be as productive due to reduced man power. These random holidays also slowed our initial progress, so
it can feel like we are trying to play catch up. We are also nearing deadlines for our STR meeting with the Colorado
RockSat-X group, so I am beginning to feel the pressure of that as I do not feel our team has accomplished as much
as I would like us to.

\subsubsubsection{Michael Humphrey}
This is a cumulative update for the first three weeks of Winter term.

\textbf{Progress} \\
The progress we've made up to this point includes installing Atmel Studio, 
setting up a solution for our class, and setting up several skeleton files. 
I've created a file for the first phase of the program; the idle phase. It is 
mostly filled out except for the code to interface with the pin. I've also set
up a file in our Google Drive detailing rules and instructions for laying out 
our project and how we will develop. We also had a meeting with the EEs about 
any telemetry data they need transmitted. They reported that they have no 
special need for transmitting telemetry via the microcontroller (all the data 
they need will be hard-wired to the telemetry interface), so I can freely 
design and implement the telemetry code without any outside interference.

\textbf{Plans} \\
My plan for the next week is to become up to speed with the driver and 
interface that the EE team has created for us, so that I can begin full-time 
development on the project. I plan to finish designing and start implementing 
the telemetry code, as well as finalize the idle phase of the code.

\textbf{Problems} \\
Problems I encountered these first few weeks include waiting for the EEs to 
develop the motor drivers and telemetry interface. Other problems include team
members not showing up to cross-functional team meetings, so we couldn't get 
information on how to use the drivers and interface. We had to schedule a 
special meeting much later with the EEs so we can start using the code they 
wrote.

\subsubsection{Week 4}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week was continuing research into the pathing and automation portion of the software. I have found that the A* algorithm for pathfinding within a configuration space will be a good solution. Additionally, we will be breaking up the arm into its individual links in order to move the arm to a valid configuration. Essentially, we will start at the base of the arm and move that first, then move up the arm to the next link and move that.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
The next week will be finishing up the research phase for pathing and automation and starting implementations. We will be starting with building the Configuration Space.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
We still haven't figured out a good way to build a C-Space.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week, I was able to get all the code up on Github for the SD card interface with the microcontrollers. Me and 
the EE's (namely Jonathan Hardman) are working on implementing the remaining functions and pre-processor directives 
for our SD card interface file. We should have that done by next Tuesday. Jonathan also updated the drivers and 
uploaded 
them on Google Drive, so I will import those over to Github. Now that these drivers are almost completely ready, I am 
looking forward to working on more implementation that actually utilizes the libraries and drivers that we have 
gotten. This step, however, hinges on having motors and a working prototype ready so we can determine whether our
arm movements are correct. This will not be ready soon as our funding has been delayed leaving us with no money for 
purchasing these motors.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
Next steps include nailing down with Michael what information we are sending over telemetry and what of that 
information should be sent to the SD Card. Next steps also include getting the updated code from Jonathan and getting
 the drivers up on Github and fully implemented.
 The CS 462 class is also requiring that we update some of our previous documents and get all our deliverables up onto
One Note, so we will do that as well. Lastly, we have a big meeting with our sponsors in Colorado next week, so we
have some slideshow slides that we need to complete. 

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
We are in a stage where we need to start divvying out tasks
and better communicating as a team. We also have dependencies that are reliant upon other teams that we have no way 
of controlling, such as the lack of motors.

\subsubsubsection{Michael Humphrey}
\textbf{Progress} \\
This week I hit a major personal milestone for this project. I finally was 
able to compile the (mostly useless) code we've all written so far this term 
and run it on the actual microcontroller! It compiled successfully for me, and
although it didn't do much it was a relief to see the fruits of our labor to 
work. The code did not compile on Amber's computer, but that was probably 
because she is using a mac and mac's are not directly supported by the avr 
compiler. I helped her troubleshoot a little bit, but she eventually figured 
it out on her own. I also added to our Description of Operations to detail 
more about the telemetry codes. Other than that, this week was spent waiting 
for drivers from the EE team for motors and pin inputs.

\textbf{Plans} \\
My plan for the next 
week is to create some constants in the telemetry header file that will encode
telemetry codes as well as constants for telemetry operation (such as the 
length of time codes will be broadcasted).

\textbf{Problems} \\
No problems encountered.

\subsubsection{Week 5}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week was focusing on figuring out how to build the configuration space (C-Space) in which to perform the path-finding algorithm for the arm's motion. We found that the C-Space need to be in \(R^4\) because we have 4 degrees of freedom in the arm. We also know that for each possible configuration of the arms' motors, we need to know if the configuration is valid in order to map the C-Space. This week we are also starting on the slide for STR.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
The next week will focus on finalizing the slides for STR. Our STR presentation will be at 6am on Friday of week 6. In addition to STR, the Pathing and Automation and Software groups will be meeting with Dr. Smart during week 6 to discuss methods for building the configuration space.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
I am blocked from progressing further with the code for motion planning because we do not yet know enough about the C-Space and how to build it. This should be resolved next week after meeting with Dr. Smart.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\
This week I worked on furthering the progress on our SD card implementation. I updated the Makefile such that the 
library now compiles with the rest of the program. Jonathan also updated the code such that it uses the correct pins
and is designed with our Atmega64 in mind. Since the FatFS library is meant to be generalizable across different
microcontrollers, there are some functions that are left as user-designed so that they can be written for specific
microcontrollers. We completed those parts of the code, so the library should be fully functional now.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
Our next work will be to test the SD card library. We are also prepping for our STR presentation with our contacts
in Colorado, so we have to complete an extensive PowerPoint skeleton that they provide us. We will also be meeting with
Dr. Smart (a professor in the Mechanical Engineering department) to discuss path-finding for our mechanical arm.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
Our main blockers are lack of communication between team members. Despite putting a scrum document into affect and 
requiring each individual team member to add to the document every Monday and Thursday, some members of the team
have been failing to meet this requirement, so it is difficult to know what is going on between other subteams
and what our individual team members are doing on their own time. We also have regularly scheduled meetings, but
attendance has been rather lax on those with team members either forgetting or making excuses right before the meeting
time. Despite us stressing the importance of attending these meetings and communicating relevant information, our team
still struggles with this, so some measures must be taken. However, we are unsure at the time of writing this what
those measures should be. 

\subsubsubsection{Michael Humphrey}
\textbf{Progress} \\
This week I updated my three sections of the design document. Additionally, I 
reviewed the tech and requirements, but no changes were required to either of 
these documents. Additionally, I met with our TA to review feedback on these 
documents last time they were graded, but there was not much feedback. I 
communicated the feedback there was to the rest of the team.

\textbf{Plans} \\
For the next week, I hope to finish the idle phase by implementing the flags 
provided in the drivers. Additionally, I would like to complete writing 
definitions for codes in the telemetry header file.

\textbf{Problems} \\
No problems encountered.

\subsubsection{Week 6}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week involved finishing the presentation for STR, a all-team social event, presenting STR, and meeting with Dr. Smart. The meeting with Dr. Smart was on Monday and provided a lot of useful information for pathfinding and automation. We discussed methods for creating the Configuration Space. Dr. Smart explained the ways in which we should limit the payload to keep the configuration space as a plane in R4. We also discussed the best way to generate the configuration space. The options that we discussed were calculating it mathematically using Inverse Kinematics, running a simulation in solid works, or physically moving the arm to valid configurations and mapping those. Each of these methods has benefits and drawbacks. STR occured on friday. In preparation we created the slides throughout the week. On thursday, at our all-team meeting, we went through all the slides in preparation for the presentation on Friday at 6am. The presentation went very well on Friday. The project reviewer said that she was excited to see our project and that our presentation and progress were both very good. The all-team social was at the All-Team meeting on Thursday after we finished all relevant business. We ordered pizza and played board games. The Software team was divided between the two teams with Michael and I against Amber. Amber's team won the first two rounds, but Michael and I brought in a win in the last round. All in all, it was an effective evening of work and team bonding.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
The next week will focus on creating and recording our presentation for the Senior Design class. We will be working on the presentation on Tuesday, finishing it on Wednesday in order to record the video on Wednesday or Thursday. We will finish the project with editing and posting the video on Thursday and Friday to have it done by Friday. I will also be updating the design documents from last term to reflect the changes we have made. I do not expect there to be significant changes, however there may be some slight modifications to the pathfinding and automation section to reflect what Dr. Smart taught us this week.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
The motors have arrived, so I am no longer blocked on progressing in the code. Following the completion of the presentation for CS462, I will be able to dive into the pathfinding code.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week was focused primarily on prepping for our big STR presentation. This is a presentation where we review our 
subsystem testing for the RockSat-X group in Colorado. The meeting was at 6 AM on Friday and required us to prepare a 
lot of slides for a slideshow. We also met with Dr. Smart to learn more about preparing our C-Space for 
pathing the arm's movement and determining what are and aren't legal movements for the arm. There are multiple ways
to do this as we can either use inverse kinematics, manually moving the arm through different legal motions and 
recording the different degrees of rotation the motors are in, or using sensors on the motors to determine their 
rotation. We are hoping to do the last option.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
Next week we shall work on the presentation for this class. Fortunately, we can lift a lot of the work we did last 
week so it shouldn't be too cumbersome. I will also be meeting with the EE's on Friday to work on testing the SD Card 
implementation and also continue work on the code for moving the arm.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
Blockers this week were the fact that I was running a study at IBM so I was out of town most of the weekend and could 
not do work for this since I was busy preparing for that. This should not be a problem now that the study is 
concluded.

\subsubsubsection{Michael Humphrey}
\textbf{Progress} \\
The bulk of this week's work was spent editing the software slides for the STR
presentation. In addition to this, I implemented the remaining portions of the
idle phase code and sat in on a meeting with Dr. Smart about robotic arm 
movement and pathing. From that I have a much better idea on how the pathing 
algorithm will work.

\textbf{Plans} \\
My plan for next week will be slightly smaller in scope due to personal 
obligations. However, I will make sure my portions of the requirements and 
design documents are up to date and that we're on track to complete the 
assignment we received an extension on. I also plan on finally completing the 
telemetry header file, as well as signing up our team for the expo.

\textbf{Problems} \\
Nothing currently blocking.

\subsubsection{Week 7}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week was focused on preparing the Midterm project update for the Senior Design course. I started the slides on Monday using our STR presentation as a base and added more details on the software side of the project and deleted many of the slides from STR that were focused on the hardware side. On Thursday we met as a group to finalize the slides and record the audio. Michael then edited the audio while I worked on updating our written documents for last term, compiling my blog posts, and starting the retrospective. Also on Thursday was the all-team meeting. We discussed funding issues because AIAA will not be contributing as much money to the project as they initially said they would, so we now have about \$30,000 to fund raise. We will all be reaching out to previous employers, etc. to raise the remainder of the funds.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
The next week will focus on building the configuration space. We are still trying to get motors to use for this step since they need to be back-driven and have encoders. We will be buying foam to line the payload. We will then line the payload with foam to provide a buffer of forbidden space in the C-Space before any collision occurs between the arm and payload. Next we will attach the motors to the arm and an arduino. We will use the arduino to read values from the motors as we back-drive them through every valid configuration. Finally, we will use this data to build the c-space. This will take up most of the week. The only other plan is that the Tuesday Senior Design class is required attendance.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
We have not yet found motors to use for building the C-Space.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week, our team worked on finishing our presentation and design documents for the Midterm Review. We also resolved some inter-personal conflicts due 
to some previous issues that had been presented by teammates regarding showing up to meetings and making contributions clear to all. Both these things 
were useful for determining our team's success and ensuring we are on the right track moving forward as we finish off the term. I also worked with the 
Electrical Engineer's on a testing suite for the SD Card library we implemented. However, this has been rather difficult as it is difficult to figure out 
errors for a microcontroller when it does not display feedback regarding what part of the code went wrong. We were trying to mitigate this by having LEDs 
that would light up when certain parts of the code failed, but I was not able to borrow the LED component attached to PORTD for the weekend. I will most 
likely continue attempting to isolate the error or else meet and discuss with the EE's soon.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
Plans for the upcoming week is to go to our mandatory class tomorrow where we will present our elevator pitches. I will also attempt to meet up with the 
EE's so we can be done with this SD Card business.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
The code failing to work has been the biggest blocker, and it could be due to many different potential issues. One reason could be that the pins are 
misconfigured or that there's something wrong in my code. The EE's were in charge of ensuring the drivers for the SD Card were correct and I was in 
charge of getting the testing code up and running so I'm not sure which end is failing.

\subsubsubsection{Michael Humphrey}
\textbf{Progress} \\
This week I have made absolutely no progress. I have been kept busy with grad 
school application and other personal issues. Progress will resume after March
1st.

\textbf{Plans} \\
Goal for next week is start writing telemetry header file.ash

\textbf{Problems} \\
No issues.

\subsubsection{Week 8}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week was focused on preparing the payload to build the configuration space. On Tuesday I went to the required Senior Design class. I wrote and practiced pitching and talking about the Hephaestus project. After class I talked to McGrath about getting motors with encoders to build the Configuration Space. He gave us three motors that we can back-drive and hook up to an arduino. Later in the day on Tuesday I worked with the Pathfinding and Automation team to prepare the payload to build the C-Space. I bought foam board and cut out pieces of it to line the payload. With this complete, we need to attach the motors to the arm and the arduino then read the values from the motor.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
The next week will mostly be working on the C-Space more and the arm control software. I will be starting by writing arduino code that we can use to build the C-Space. I will be working on that this weekend. Once that is complete, we will build the C-Space. After we have the C-Space, I will start the arm control software that will plot the path through the C-Space and move the arm along the path.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
None.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week I've primarily been working on the SD card implementation. While testing the software earlier this week, I realized that something must be 
wrong on the EE's side of the implementation effort as our card wasn't even able to initialize properly. I met with Jonathan and we got that part working 
while also giving me a bit of code that I could use to test line-by-line the implementation of the library we're using to isolate errors and either fix 
or hand off depending how outside of my abilities they are. So, as I've stepped through the code, I've isolated and fixed multiple errors. However, this 
is a very slow task so despite me putting hours into this effort progress has been slow-going. This is a very large library with lots of lines of code 
that's functionality is kind of obscured and with minimal ability to debug (just a single set of changing LED lights depending upon whether conditions 
pass or fail) this has been rather difficult.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
I will continue working on getting this SD card implementation working but will change my time needs as necessary, especially once the arm is in a state 
where code is ready to be written for it. However, that is not the case in this current time.


\textbf{Problems} \\ 
Blockers are mainly that this is challenging and I am looking for outside support outside of Jonathan who says he won't really have time to help me until 
dead week. I've emailed Roger Traylor but he does not seem super familiar with this branch of work. I might also email Ben Lee.

\subsubsubsection{Michael Humphrey}
\textbf{Progress} \\
Not much progress this week. Can't develop without a prototype to test on. 
Can't write code if we can't run it. (I mean we could but that would be a 
colossally awful idea.)

\textbf{Plans} \\
Plan for next week is to design and begin implementation of motor test. This 
test (or tests) won't be used during the payload deployment on the rocket, but 
they will be used to demonstrate the payload actually works on earth, for 
various design requirements.

\textbf{Problems} \\
Only problems are that the Pathing team is hogging the only working prototype.

\subsubsection{Week 9}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
My primary goal this week was to get an initial mapping of the C-Space. I met this goal. On Tuesday I met with Pathing and Automation to start work on the Arduino code to map the C-Space. They had a start to it with three motors on interrupts and printing their values to Serial out. Unfortunately, the Arduino UNO only has two interrupt pins, so I had to switch one of the motors to poll instead of interrupt. This took a few tries, but by Thursday, which is when we met next, I had a motor polling instead of interrupting. I had also fixed the print statements to be more useful to us. However the code still had some bugs. We ran out of time on Thursday and had to go to the All-Team meeting, so we met up the next day as well. On Friday I finished debugging the Arduino code and we were finally ready to map the C-Space. I ran the arm all around the payload so we now have an initial data set on the shape of the C-Space to play with.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
My next step in the software is to write a parser for the C-Space data. It is currently in the form of one motor angle per line, with the triples separated by a line with a semicolon on it. So I will go from:

\[ theta1 theta2 theta3 ;\]

to:

\[ point_n = <0, theta1, theta2, theta3> \]

I will have a 4D array of 1's, then fill in a 0 in every location indicated by point\_n above. The 4D C-Space will then contain a 0 for every valid configuration of motors and a 1 for every invalid configuration.

Once I have an initial C-Space, I will need to do some repair on it to smooth out the C-Space. This will account for angles that are valid but were not sampled.

My other goal for Week 10 is to help the ME's test the payload. They are all finishing up their capstone class, so they need to have a bunch of tests done to show that their parts of the project work. They will need some help from CS and EE in order to test how their hardware parts all work in motion. I will be helping them to write code to move the arm and to devise test cases.


\textbf{Problems} \\ 
I currently have way too many projects going on. All of my classes have final projects, so I am worried that I will not have time to get it all done.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week, I successfully resolved the issues preventing a function within the FatFS library working. The issue was due to an internal issue that caused 
the wrong, non-SD card specific function from being called. After debugging for a bit with Michael, we found this error and were able to get the SD 
Card mounted to the microcontroller and the file pointer to be opened and set to an internal location for a file to be created and written to. We also 
met with Roger Traylor who confirmed for us using an oscilloscope that the correct bytes were being spammed over SPI, showing that our code was doing 
what we expected it to do at the point we fixed during the execution. Furthermore, I met with my physical integration team to get the wires correctly set 
up for the payload and helped tap the metal plate our payload will be mounted on. This was exciting as I hardly ever get to do hands-on work with 
hardware, so I enjoyed getting to work with our mechanical engineers on this process.

\textbf{Plans} \\
Next week I will continue running through the program to debug issues relating to writing to the file and figure out what is going on with that. I will 
also be recording our final project presentation with my software team and preparing for our integrated system testing review for the RockSat-X program.

\textbf{Problems} \\
Blockers currently include the fact that this code isn't working as intended. While I was able to fix one problem, I almost immediately ran into another 
issue. This is a rather time-consuming process so, while it is a cool thing relating to the overall project, it may need to be dropped if my efforts are 
needed in a more critical area relating to the project.

\subsubsubsection{Michael Humphrey}
\textbf{Progress} \\
This week I worked with Jonathan Hardman from the electrical team to create a 
test program to run the arm. It operates each motor individually to 
demonstrate its full range of motion. The Robots team said they needed the 
file as soon as possible, so I dropped everything to make it. They did not end
up using it.

\textbf{Plans} \\
Next week I plan on working on the slides for our next big presentation, 
Integrated Subsystem Test Review. It is on Friday of finals week. I also plan 
to do the majority of the work for the final presentation and report for this 
class.

\textbf{Problems} \\
Nothing blocking.

\subsubsection{Week 10}
\subsubsubsection{Helena Bales}
\textbf{Progress} \\ 
This week has been an extremely stressful one. All of my classes have final projects. I have not had time to write the parser for the C-Space data. I did update the presentation for the Final Update video. I have some more visuals to add, but I have recorded most of my audio.

We are also working on the presentation today. We did not realize that it was due tonight, so we will be getting most of it done at 4pm today. Needless to say, we are are stressed by this looming deadline.

\textbf{Plans} \\ 
Configuration Space: \\ 
My next step in the software is still to write a parser for the C-Space data. It is currently in the form of one motor angle per line, with the triples separated by a line with a semicolon on it. So I will go from:

\[ theta1 theta2 theta3 ; \]

to:

\[ point_n = <0, theta1, theta2, theta3> \]

I will have a 4D array of 1's, then fill in a 0 in every location indicated by point\_n above. The 4D C-Space will then contain a 0 for every valid configuration of motors and a 1 for every invalid configuration.

Once I have an initial C-Space, I will need to do some repair on it to smooth out the C-Space. This will account for angles that are valid but were not sampled.

Fundraising: \\ 
My other goal for Finals Week is to contact people to ask for funding for our project. We also have ISTR on Friday of Finals week, so we will be spending some time during Finals week working on the presentation for that. We will also be finishing up our presentation and video for this class.

Expo Poster: \\ 
Finally, we will be completing the Expo poster next week as we got an extension from Kirsten. I have defined the general sections on the poster in the poster template. This will cover the sections of the poster, the images on the poster, and the assignments for text and graphics.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
I currently have way too many projects going on. All of my classes have final projects, so I am worried that I will not have time to get it all done. Additionally, I feel the stress of the end of the term is affecting the effectiveness of our team. Spring break will help with that.

\subsubsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\textbf{Progress} \\
Due to it being dead week, not much progress was made on my end. Our team recorded some segments of our presentation and I made a tiny bit of progress on
the code but I am still a bit confused about the way it's behaving. I'm looking forward to spring break where I can work on it freely. Our team also has 
ISTR this week and perhaps a social Thursday evening.

\textbf{Plans} \\
Future work - continue working on code.

\textbf{Problems} \\ 
Blockers: none.

\textbf{Progress} \\
This week I developed an application to read data from a file (ostensibly 
temperature data from a file on the on-board SD card) and display a graph of 
that data. This program is a prototype for our final application to fulfill 
the Data Visualization component of the requirements. The program is a Python 
script with the graph created using the matplotlib library. The program was 
made now to help the Electrical team fulfill a requirement for their senior 
design class.

In addition to the program described above to display the data file, I created
a helper program (also in Python) to generate the data file with random data. 
The temperature sensor that will generate the data only produces 10-bit 
values, so the random data generator must simulate that output. The program 
generates a random value between 0 and 1,023 (inclusive) and outputs it as a 
two byte sequence to a file specified in the arguments to the script. The 
program repeats this 100 times, outputting a null byte (0) as a separator 
between each value. This file can then be used as an input file for the data 
processing program.

\textbf{Plans} \\
Next week will be spent working on the senior design report and presentation. 

\textbf{Problems} \\
Nothing blocking.
