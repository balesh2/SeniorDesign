\subsubsection{If you could do it all over what would you do differently?}
If I could redo this whole project and the whole year, I would want to get the Configuration Space done way sooner. If we had talked to Dr. Smart earlier on in Fall Term and found the motors that we needed before Winter Term, we would have been able to get a lot more done. However knowing who to talk to and what hardware we needed was a challenge of its own. It would have been helpful to start the fundraising earlier as well. If I had been introduced to my contact at the OSU Foundation earlier in the year, he might have been able to help us apply for more grants. But once again that is not something that I could change.

One technical change that I would make is to increase the power of the \gls{obc} as that is a serious limiting factor for our ability to perform the pathing computations on orbit, or even storing a full, detailed configuration space. Our choice of \gls{obc} was somewhat limited by budget. In the future, further fundraising or support from the school for missions could alleviate this concern.
