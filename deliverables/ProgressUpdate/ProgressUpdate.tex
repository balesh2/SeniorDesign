\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Document Overview}
The progress of our project shall be outlined in this document. The document shall discuss the purpose of our project,
the mission success criteria, and the current status of our project. This document will focus on the individual
progress reports from each team member.
\section{Project Overview}
\subsection{Project Purpose}
The Oregon State University RockSat-X team will demonstrate that an autonomous robotic arm can locate predetermined
 targets around the payload under microgravity conditions by using precise movements. 
The technical actions performed by this demonstration will illustrate a proof of concept for creating assemblies, 
autonomous repairs, and performing experiments in space. 
\subsection{Mission Success Criteria}
The Oregon State University RockSat-X team will demonstrate that an autonomous robotic arm can locate predetermined targets around the 
payload under microgravity conditions by using precise movements. The technical actions performed by this demonstration will illustrate 
a proof of concept for creating assemblies, autonomous repairs, and performing experiments in space. 
The mission objectives are to deploy a robotic payload capable of moving with four axes of freedom; deploy a Camera with a single axis 
of freedom;
enact a series of pre-scripted movements by the arm including contact with stationary sensors;
coordinate the Camera to track arm movements and record demonstration; and
store sensor data for when arm is at rest, and when it comes into contact with station sensors.
