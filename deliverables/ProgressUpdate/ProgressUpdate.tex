\begin{abstract}
The \gls{osu} RockSat-X team shall be named Hephaestus.
The progress of our project shall be outlined in this document.
The mission requires that the \gls{payload}, an autonomous robotic arm, perform a series of motions to locate predetermined targets.
The hardware shall be capable of performing the motions to reach the targets.
The software shall determine the targets and send the commands to the hardware to execute the motion.
The combination of the hardware controlled by the software shall demonstrate Hephaestus's ability to construct small parts on orbit.

\section{Introduction}
The Hephaestus Payload is a rocketry \gls{payload} that will fly onboard the 2016-2017 RockSat-X rocket. 
The rocket will be launched from Wallops Flight Facility filled with
student-made \glspl{payload}. 
The Hephaestus \gls{payload} will be made up of a \gls{deployable} arm and a video camera. The arm will perform 
a series of motions that will be recorded by the video camera and sensors. Following the experiment, the 
arm will retract back into the rocket. The Hephaestus mission will be Oregon State University's first 
space mission and will prove not only our ability to develop a space-ready
\gls{payload}, but also the 
viability of construction in space using a robotic arm.

\subsection{Document Overview}
This document will serve as a progress update following Fall term of 2016. At the time of writing, we 
have worked on the Hephaestus \gls{payload} for ten weeks. This document will include an overview of the 
project goals and purpose, our work so far, the problems we have encountered, and a retrospective.

\section{Project Overview}
\subsection{Project Purpose}
The Oregon State University RockSat-X team will demonstrate that an autonomous robotic arm can locate predetermined
 targets around the \gls{payload} under microgravity conditions by using precise movements. 
The technical actions performed by this demonstration will illustrate a proof of concept for creating assemblies, 
autonomous repairs, and performing experiments in space.
\subsection{Mission Success Criteria}
The Oregon State University RockSat-X team will demonstrate that an autonomous robotic arm can locate predetermined targets around the 
\gls{payload} under microgravity conditions by using precise movements. The technical actions performed by this demonstration will illustrate 
a proof of concept for creating assemblies, autonomous repairs, and performing experiments in space. 
The mission objectives are to deploy a robotic \gls{payload} capable of moving with four axes of freedom; deploy a Camera with a single axis 
of freedom;
enact a series of pre-scripted movements by the arm including contact with stationary sensors;
coordinate the Camera to track arm movements and record demonstration; and
store sensor data for when arm is at rest, and when it comes into contact with station sensors.

\section{Conclusion}
The Hephaestus \gls{payload} will be Oregon State University's first space mission. 
It will prove the viability of construction in space using a mechanical arm 
capable of detailed maneuvers. The project is currently on schedule, with a 
launch in Summer of 2017. We have designed the software system to be applied to 
the hardware designed by the Mechanical Engineering teams and the Electrical 
Engineering team. During the course of this term, we encountered several 
problems, all of which we overcame through communication and time management. 
Following the completion of this term, the Hephaestus team will begin 
construction of the \gls{payload} and develoment of the software.
