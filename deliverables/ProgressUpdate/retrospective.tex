We started meeting early in the project, before the term had started & Michael was left off of the emails
during the first couple of weeks & Added Michael to the email list \\ \hline

We communicated with the larger team by holding weekly meetings & Meetings were inefficient due to the range of topics
discussed with few topics being of interest to everyone & Planning to have cross-functional team meetings
next term instead of one large group meeting \\ \hline

 & A lot of illnesses, technical difficulties, and traveling that interfered with team productivity 
& Having a chat for our group on GroupMe (mobile application) and
becoming more proficient in Git helps with doing remote work \\ \hline

Team has produced consistently high-quality work & Producing high quality work has been stressful for everyone
& Asked for extensions when our team needed it, as opposed to "powering through the pain" \\ \hline

We had three design reviews with the RockSat-X program office where we presented to a reviewer. This helped
us formally document the overall project. & Due to the time difference, we had to present at 7 AM
& Not mark "7 AM" as a time we are all available \\ \hline

We made good visuals during our design process & Designing useful visuals is time consuming
& Continue making visuals (including 3D visuals) \\ \hline

We discussed the incorrect assumptions to get everyone on the same page 
& Occasional miscommunications between everyone regarding incorrect assumptions about the design
& Continue discussing misconceptions when they come up \\ \hline
