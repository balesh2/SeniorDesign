\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The Oregon State University RockSat-X team shall be name Hephaestus.
The possible methods for implementing our project requirements shall be outlined in this document.
The mission requires that the payload, an autonomous robotic arm, perform a series of motions to locate predetermined targets.
The hardware shall be capable of performing the motions to reach the targets.
The software shall determine the targets and send the commands to the hardware to execute the motion.
The combination of the hardware controlled by the software shall demonstrate Hephaestus's ability to construct small parts on orbit.
This document will focus on the implementation of the software, but shall include necessary project context including hardware.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Document Overview}
This is the Technical Review And Implementation Plan for the Hephaestus project.
This document shall investigate possible methods of implementing our project software requirements.
The nine general requirements investigated below were identified as project requirements in our Requirements document.
This document will focus on the "how" of our requirements implementation.
