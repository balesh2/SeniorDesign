\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The \gls{OSU} RockSat-X team shall be name Hephaestus.
The possible methods for implementing our project requirements shall be outlined in this document.
The mission requires that the payload, an autonomous robotic arm, perform a series of motions to locate predetermined targets.
The hardware shall be capable of performing the motions to reach the targets.
The software shall determine the targets and send the commands to the hardware to execute the motion.
The combination of the hardware controlled by the software shall demonstrate Hephaestus's ability to construct small parts on orbit.
This document will focus on the implementation of the software, but shall include necessary project context including hardware.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Document Overview}
This is the Technical Review And Implementation Plan for the Hephaestus project.
This document shall investigate possible methods of implementing our project software requirements.
The nine general requirements investigated below were identified as project requirements in our Requirements document.
This document will focus on the "how" of our requirements implementation.
\subsection{Role Breakdown}
Each CS Senior Design team member shall be responsible for insuring the completion of the three items
from the requirements document that are assigned to them below.
\subsubsection{Helena Bales}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Target Generation}
\item{Arm Movement}
\item{Arm Position Tracking}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Amber Horvath}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Emergency Payload Expulsion}
\item{Program Modes of Operation}
\item{Target Success Sensors}
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Michael Humphrey}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Telemetry}
\item{Video Camera}
\item{Data Visualization and Processing}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Technologies}
\subsection{Target Generation}
\subsubsection{Requirement Overview}
The software shall generate points to be used in testing the Hephaestus arm.
The points will constitute the total test of the arm, and should therefore include points
representative of standard and edge cases.
These points shall be used as targets for the arm body.
\subsubsection{Proposed Solutions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{
\textbf{The points shall be generated in 3-D polar form}, including an angle from normal, a radius, 
and a height. 
The angle shall be in the range of 0 and 359 degrees.
An angle of zero degrees shall be in the direction of payload deployment.
The radius shall be the distance from the arm's attachment to the base to the generated point.
The height of the point, for the purpose of target generation, shall be constant.
However the points will always be stored in a triple of angle from normal (\(\theta\)), radius (\(r\)), and height (\(h\)).
}
\item{
\textbf{The points shall be generated in 3-D Cartesian form}, including \(x\) position to the right 
or left of the \(y-axis\), the \(y\) position above or below the \(x-axis\), and the height, \(h\), 
above the \(xy-plane\).
Let the \(y-axis\) be the direction that the payload deploys from the can.
Let the \(x-axis\) be the perpendicular to the \(y-axis\) at the point where the arm is mounted 
to the rotating plate. 
Let \(h\) be the height above the \(xy-plane\), where the arm is attached to the rotating plate.
}
\item{
\textbf{The points shall be generated in 2-D Polar coordinates}, where the implementation is the 
same as described in the 3-D Polar coordinate section, with the exception of \(h\).
In this case, there shall be no \(h\).
The position can be represented in 2-D Polar coordinates on the plane of the base plate.
For the purpose of compatability with the position of the arm, the height could be assumed to be 0.
}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Arm Movement}
\subsubsection{Requirement Overview}
The software shall control the movement of the arm body assembly. 
The position of the tip of the arm shall be tracked in the coordinate notation described in section 2.2 above.
The software shall rotate the arm body assembly in a full 360 degrees.
The software shall additionally control the movement the height of the arm body assembly.
The arm should descend and touch the baseplate of the payload at any rotation.

TODO ADD MORE
\subsubsection{Proposed Solutions}

\subsection{Arm Position Tracking}
\subsubsection{Requirement Overview}
The position of the arm shall be tracked using the same coordinate system described in the Target Generation requirement.
The position of the arm shall be calculated using the known start position and the rotation of the motors.
The starting position shall be known due to a calibration point that will allow for a reset at any time.
Resetting in this way will allow for flexibility between resetting for maximum operation time with only tolerably small error defined by the Non Functional Requirements.
