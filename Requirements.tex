\begin{abstract}
The Oregon State University RockSat-X team shall be name Hephaestus.
The requirements for the hardware, software, and programmatic development of Hephaestus shall be outlined in the following document.
The mission requires that the payload, an autonomous robotic arm, perform a series of motions to locate predetermined targets.
The hardware shall be capable of performing the motions to reach the targets.
The software shall determine the targets and send the commands to the hardware to execute the motion.
The combination of the hardware controlled by the software shall demonstrate Hephaestus's ability to construct small parts on orbit.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of Document}
This document shall describe in detail the Hephaestus RockSat-X payload.
It specifies the software behavior of the payload.
This document will not discuss the specific implementations of the hardware or the software.
It will specify the behavior by describing the Functional and Non Functional requirements of the software.
This document will be updated throughout the project.
\subsection{Overview of Document}
This document will first cover the functional requirements of the project, then the non functional requirements.
The Functional Requirements will include descriptions of the main behavior, target generation, movement, operation modes, and telemetry.
Each of these topics will include descriptions of the behavioral requirements for each.
The Non Functional requirements will cover the performance, security, and telemetry.
Each of the non functional topics covered will include the requirements for the quality of each of the topics.
